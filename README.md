# INE5418 - Distributed Computing

Welcome to my repository for **INE5418 - Distributed Computing**, a course I'm taking at the **Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC)** in the **2nd semester of 2024**. This repository contains my work, notes, and projects related to the course.

## Course Overview

**Course Code:** INE5418

**Class:** 05208

**Credit Hours:** 72 hours (40 theoretical, 32 practical)

**Instructors:**

- Prof. Odorico Machado Mendizabal - odorico.mendizabal@ufsc.br
- Prof. Antonio Augusto Medeiros Frohlich - antonio.frohlich@ufsc.br

## Repository Purpose

This repository is a collection of my personal work for the course, including:

- Assignments
- Project files
- Notes and summaries
- Code examples and exercises

It serves as a way to document my learning process and share my progress throughout the semester.

## Course Content

The course covers the following topics:

1. **Fundamentals of Distributed Computing**
    - Distributed Systems Architecture
    - Distributed Computing Paradigms
    - Computational Support
    - Interprocess Communication
    - Distributed File Systems
2. **Technologies for Distributed Computing**
    - Distributed Objects
    - Web Services
    - Peer-to-Peer Networks
    - Message-Oriented Middleware
    - Distributed Shared Memory
    - Grid and Cloud Computing
3. **Algorithms for Distributed Computing**
    - Group Communication
    - Clock Synchronization
    - Election and Mutual Exclusion Algorithms
    - Deadlock Detection
    - Consensus Algorithms

## Methodology

The course will cover theoretical topics through lectures, slides, and group discussions. Practical demonstrations, exercises, and case studies will be used to complement the learning experience. Students will engage in practical exercises involving programming implementations in the lab.

## Evaluation

Students will be evaluated based on the following activities:

- **Theoretical Exam (P):** 60% of the final grade.
- **Two Practical Assignments (T1 and T2):** 40% of the final grade.The final grade will be calculated as:MF=0.6×P+0.4×MT, where MT=(T1+T2)/2.
    
    MF=0.6×P+0.4×MTMF = 0.6 \times P + 0.4 \times MT
    
    MT=(T1+T2)/2MT = (T1 + T2)/2
    

**Note:** Practical assignments will be graded on both the implementation and the presentation or report. The specific criteria include knowledge, solution quality, performance, clarity, and adherence to deadlines.

## Schedule

- **Assignment T1 Due:** 10th week
- **Theoretical Exam (P):** Third-to-last week of the academic calendar
- **Assignment T2 Due:** Second-to-last week of the semester
- **Recovery Exam (REC):** Last week of the academic calendar

A detailed schedule, description of assignments, and exam dates will be provided on the Moodle platform at the beginning of the semester.
